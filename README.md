# toonME---Rowdyhacks-2021

ToonMe is an image filtering program inspired by Snapchat filters and Apple Photo Booth. Our team wanted to learn more about openCV and image processing, so we decided to experiment with the effects of applying different thresholds and blurring techiniques to find the perfect settings for the filters. ToonMe has the option between a comic-book-style, cel-shaded filter as well as a chalky, hand-drawn filter. The team's love for vibrant comic book art made toonMe a very fun exploration into comupter vision that taught us more about techniques used to prepare images for machine learning, object tracking, and more.
